    <h1>Angel</h1>
    <p>
    By gates of Eden, Angel, gentle,
Shone with his softly drooped head,
And Demon, gloomy and resentful
Over the hellish crevasse flapped.
<br>
<br>
The spirit of qualm and negation
Looked at another one – of good,
And fire of the forced elation
First time he vaguely understood.
<br>
<br>
“I’ve seen you,” he enunciated, -  
“And not in vain you’ve sent me light:
Not all in heaven I have hated,
Not all in world I have despised.”
